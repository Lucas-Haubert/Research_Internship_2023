# Research Internship in Stochastics and Statistics, University of Oslo, 2023

## Overview

This repository is contains my work as a research intern at the University of Oslo, in 2023, oriented towards the study of stocastic volatility models via high-frequancy financial data. The objective is to explore the methodologies and implications of each volatility models, for a various range of assets, in order to study the variability of the prices in a relevant way.
